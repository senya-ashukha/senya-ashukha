I am a Senior Research Scientist at [Isomorphic Labs](https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/), Alphabet company led by Demis Hassabis, where I work on AI-first drug design. Before joining Isomorphic, I worked at Samsung AI and did my PhD with Dmitry Vetrov, in collaboration with Max Welling. The results of my PhD contributed to sparsification, uncertainty, and generative models.
