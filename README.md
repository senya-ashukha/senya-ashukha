### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Research Scientist at <a href="https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/">Isomorphic Labs</a> @ London (UK), where I work on AI-first drug design and understanding of human biology ðŸ¤–+ðŸ§¬=ðŸ’Š. 
<br>
<br>
I did a PhD in AI/ML at  <a href="https://bayesgroup.ru/">BayesGroup</a>, so I can make big overcomplicated DNNs work. The results of my PhD contributed to sparsification, uncertainty estimation, ensembling, and fundamentals of Bayesian deep learning. I was a part of Samsung AI, Yandex Research, and University of Amsterdam. During my undergrad and master's, I did some ML engineering internships in deep learning for music, recommendation systems, and user modeling.
