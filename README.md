I am a Research Scientist at Isomorphic Labs where I work on AI-first drug design ðŸ§¬

I received a PhD in computer science from National Research University Higher School of Economics, where I worked with Dmitry Vetrov. The results of my PhD contributed to sparsification, uncertainty estimation, ensembling, and fundamentals of Bayesian deep learning. I was a part of Samsung AI, Yandex Research, and University of Amsterdam (worked with Max Welling). During my undergrad and master's, I did ML internships in deep learning for music, recommendation systems, and user modeling.
