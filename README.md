I am a Senior Research Scientist at [Isomorphic Labs](https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/), Alphabet subsidiary led by Demis Hassabis, where I develop and train deep learning models for drug descovery. Prior to joining Iso, I recived PhD in machine learning. You might have come across the following projects I worked on: [github.com/advimman/lama](github.com/advimman/lama), [github.com/SamsungLabs/pytorch-ensembles](github.com/SamsungLabs/pytorch-ensembles), [github.com/bayesgroup/variational-dropout-sparsifies-dnn](github.com/bayesgroup/variational-dropout-sparsifies-dnn).
