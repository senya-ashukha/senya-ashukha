I am a Research Scientist at Isomorphic Labs (Alphabet company, led by Demis Hassabis)  where I work on AI-first drug design and digital biology.

Before joining Isomorpic Labs, I was a PhD student at the Bayesian Methods Research Group and Reserch Scientist at Samsing AI, where I worked with Dmitry Vetrov. The results of my PhD contributed to sparsification, uncertainty estimation, ensembling, and fundamentals of Bayesian deep learning. I hold the UK Global Talant visa.
