I am a Research Scientist at [Isomorphic Labs](https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/) (Alphabet company, led by [Demis Hassabis](https://twitter.com/demishassabis))  where I work on AI-first drug design.

Before joining Isomorphic Labs, I was a PhD student at the [Bayesian Methods Research Group](https://bayesgroup.ru/) and Reserch Scientist at Samsung AI, where I worked with [Dmitry Vetrov](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=7HU0UoUAAAAJ&hl=en). The results of my PhD contributed to sparsification, uncertainty estimation, ensembling, and fundamentals of Bayesian deep learning. I hold the UK Global Talant visa.
